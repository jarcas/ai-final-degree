    "## 🧪 Anomaly Detection using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore an unsupervised anomaly detection approach using **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**.  \n",
    "The goal is to detect legitimate traffic (normal behavior) as outliers, having trained the model exclusively on malicious traffic (attacks).\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup reflects a realistic intrusion detection scenario where only attack data is available during training.  \n",
    "The model learns the underlying distribution of the attack class, and any deviation from it is treated as an anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "- Train a GMM using only attack samples.\n",
    "- Evaluate the model on a test set containing:\n",
    "  - Unseen attacks (positive class)\n",
    "  - All available normal traffic (to be detected as anomalies)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Method\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture` to learn the probabilistic distribution of attack flows.\n",
    "- Score test samples using the log-likelihood under the learned model.\n",
    "- Apply a threshold to the log-likelihood to classify samples as attack (inlier) or normal (outlier).\n",
    "- Evaluate performance using precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, and confusion matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is well-suited for highly imbalanced datasets where the minority class (normal traffic) is rare or partially labeled."

    "We evaluated the GMM-based anomaly detector by training it exclusively on attack samples  \n",

    "\n",
    "#### 📊 Interpretation of Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Log-likelihood threshold**: defined as the 5th percentile of the log-scores on the training (attack) data.\n",
    "- **Prediction rule**:\n",
    "  - If log-score > threshold → classified as **Attack**\n",
    "  - Else → classified as **Normal (anomaly)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📋 Key Metrics:\n",
    "- **Precision (Attack class)**: High precision indicates few false positives (normal samples mistakenly classified as attack).\n",
    "- **Recall (Attack class)**: Measures the ability to correctly identify attack traffic.\n",
    "- **F1-score**: Balance between precision and recall.\n",
    "- **ROC AUC**: Evaluates how well the model separates the two classes across all thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧠 Model Behavior:\n",
    "- If **recall is high**, the model detects most attacks.\n",
    "- If **precision is low**, it triggers many false alarms.\n",
    "- If **ROC AUC is high**, the model is good at ranking attacks above legitimate flows, regardless of threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📌 Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The GMM approach is effective for modeling attack behavior and identifying deviations (i.e., normal traffic).  \n",
    "The choice of threshold is critical and can be tuned further to balance false negatives and false positives depending on the use case (e.g., security sensitivity vs. alert fatigue).\n",
    "\n",
    "This method complements One-Class SVM and is especially valuable in highly imbalanced or partially labeled datasets."
